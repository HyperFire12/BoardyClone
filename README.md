BoardyClone

This is a boardy.ai clone website that I made from scratch using Next.js 14. It utilizes multiple libraries like libphonenumber-js, i18n-iso-countries and country-flag-icons to create the dropdown component to accept phone numbers. It also uses react-spring to create the infinite carousels.

To run this website in a development server, use:

```bash
npx next dev
```
or to run it in build, use:

```bash
npx next build
```
